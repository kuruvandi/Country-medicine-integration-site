## Installation

### For Windows platform
1. Download and Install [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/)
2. [Download the latest version](https://github.com/brijeshjain13/Memory-Overflow/releases) of theme from GitHub , either using [Git](https://git-scm.com/), or downloading directly:
     
     - **Note :** The master branch will be under development , so you should download the released versions
     - To download using git, install git and then type 
     
          `git clone https://github.com/brijeshjain13/Memory-Overflow.git` 

          `git checkout tags/<latest_tagged_version>`
          
     - To download directly, go to the [latest release](https://github.com/brijeshjain13/Memory-Overflow/releases) page and click **Source code** in the **Downloads** section
3. Copy the source code folder (Extracted) to `www` directory present in your WAMP installation (e.g. `C:\wamp64\www\Memory-Overflow-1.0`)
4. Change a line in your Apache `httpd.conf` file: where it says `Listen 0.0.0.0:80` change it to `Listen 127.0.0.1:80` and comment out the next line: where it says `Listen [::0]:80` to `#Listen [::0]:80`. Restart Apache. Now localhost will use IPv4 `127.0.0.1`
5. Next up open MySQL console, login with your credentials and create a database for the website
     - Illustration : `create database <database_name>;`
6. Find qa-config.php in the unzipped folder, open it in your text editor and insert the MySQL details (host name, username, password and name of the database created in the previous step) at the top, and save the file. The server host name is likely to be `127.0.0.1` or `localhost`. Do not use a word processor such as Microsoft Word for this, but rather Notepad or another appropriate [text editing program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_text_editors).
7. Open the appropriate web page for Memory Overflow in your web browser, for example:
     `http://localhost/Memory-Overflow-1.0/`
8. Follow the on-screen instructions to set up your database and administrator account
9. Drop the existing `qa_options` table in the database using the MySQL console
     - Illustration : 
     
          `use <database_name>;` 

          `drop table qa_options;`
               
10. Insert the `qa_options` table from the unzipped folder
     - Illustration : `source C:/wamp64/www/Memory-Overflow-1.0/qa_options.sql;`
11. Visit `http://localhost/Memory-Overflow-1.0/admin/donut-theme/general-settings` for configuring the theme as per your taste
